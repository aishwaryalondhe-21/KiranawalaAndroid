## ðŸŽ¯ Key Recommendations

### Technology Stack
```
Frontend:  Next.js 14 + React + TypeScript
UI:        shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
State:     TanStack Query + Zustand
Forms:     React Hook Form + Zod
Backend:   Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage)
Hosting:   Vercel
Monitoring: Sentry + Vercel Analytics
```

### Architecture Pattern
- **Feature-Based Clean Architecture** with clear separation of concerns
- **Server State:** TanStack Query for API calls, caching, real-time sync
- **Client State:** Zustand for UI state and preferences
- **Real-Time:** Supabase Realtime subscriptions for live updates

### Authentication Strategy
- **Admin Users:** Email/password authentication via Supabase Auth
- **New Table:** `store_admins` with role-based access (OWNER, MANAGER, STAFF)
- **Data Isolation:** RLS policies ensure admins only access their store's data
- **Session Management:** Secure cookies with automatic expiration

### Security Approach
- HTTPS enforced
- CSRF protection enabled
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- SQL injection prevention (Supabase parameterized queries)
- XSS protection (React auto-escaping)
- Rate limiting implemented
- Audit logging for compliance
- RLS policies for data access control
