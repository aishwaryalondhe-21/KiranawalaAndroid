#### Changed
- **Authentication Method:**

  - Wrong: `fnblhmddqregqfafqkeh`
  - Correct: `fnblhmddgregqfafqkeh`
  - This caused "Unable to resolve host" errors

- **Authentication Error:** "Signups not allowed for otp"
  - Root cause: Using `signUpWith(OTP)` which is blocked
  - Solution: Use `signInWith(OTP)` with `createUser = true`

- **Build Issues:**
  - Fixed cached APK causing old URL to persist
  - Solution: Uninstall app before installing new build

#### Configuration
- **Supabase Setup:**
  - Project URL: `https://fnblhmddgregqfafqkeh.supabase.co`
  - Phone provider enabled
  - Test phone number configured: `+919307393578=123456`
  - Test OTP valid until: October 21, 2025

- **Security:**
  - Row Level Security (RLS) policies configured
  - Encrypted token storage
  - Secure session management

#### Documentation
- Updated `README.md` with phone OTP details
- Updated `SUPABASE_SETUP.md` with complete setup instructions
- Added troubleshooting section for common issues
- Created `PHONE_OTP_SETUP.md` for quick reference

#### Testing
- ‚úÖ Phone number validation working
- ‚úÖ OTP sending successful (test mode)
- ‚úÖ OTP verification working with test code
- ‚úÖ User session creation successful
- ‚úÖ Local database sync working
- ‚úÖ Session persistence across app restarts

#### Known Limitations
- SMS provider not configured (using test OTP)
- Real SMS delivery requires Twilio/MessageBird setup
- Test OTP expires on October 21, 2025

#### Next Steps
1. Configure SMS provider for production (Twilio/MessageBird)
2. Remove test phone numbers
3. Test with real phone numbers
4. Implement Phase 3: Store Browsing

## Development Notes

### Issues Encountered and Resolved

1. **DNS Resolution Error**
   - Symptom: "Unable to resolve host fnblhmddqregqfafqkeh.supabase.co"
   - Cause: Typo in project ID (q instead of g)
   - Resolution: Corrected URL in build.gradle.kts
   - Time to fix: Multiple attempts due to cached APK

2. **Signups Blocked Error**
   - Symptom: "Signups not allowed for otp"
   - Cause: Using signUpWith(OTP) method
   - Resolution: Changed to signInWith(OTP) with createUser = true
   - Time to fix: 30 minutes of research and testing

3. **Cached APK Issue**
   - Symptom: Old URL persisting after build
   - Cause: Android not replacing APK properly
   - Resolution: Manual uninstall before each install
   - Prevention: Always uninstall when changing configuration

### Lessons Learned

1. **Always verify URLs character by character** - Small typos can cause hours of debugging
2. **Supabase OTP methods** - signInWith is more flexible than signUpWith
3. **APK caching** - Always uninstall when changing build configuration
4. **Test mode is essential** - Hardcoded OTPs allow testing without SMS costs

### Time Breakdown

- Initial implementation: 2 hours
- Debugging URL typo: 1.5 hours
- Fixing signup method: 0.5 hours
- Testing and verification: 1 hour
- Documentation: 1 hour
- **Total:** ~6 hours
