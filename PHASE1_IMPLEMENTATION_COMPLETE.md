# Phase 1 Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

## 🎉 Successfully Implemented Features

### 1. ✅ **Login Persistence Fixed** 
**Problem:** Users had to login again and again after closing the app

**Solution:** 
- Updated `SplashScreen.kt` to check for existing session using SessionManager
- App now checks if user is logged in on startup
- If logged in → Navigate to Home Screen
- If not logged in → Navigate to Login Screen

**Files Modified:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/kiranawala/presentation/screens/splash/SplashScreen.kt`

**How it works:**
```kotlin
// On app launch, SplashScreen checks session
val userId = sessionManager.getCurrentUserId()
val isLoggedIn = !userId.isNullOrBlank()

if (isLoggedIn) {
    // User stays logged in - go to Home
} else {
    // User needs to login
}
```

### 2. ✅ **Theme Toggle Foundation**
**Feature:** Light/Dark/System theme preference storage

**Implementation:**
- Added `THEME_MODE` preference key to PreferencesManager
- Added `themeMode` Flow for reactive theme updates
- Added `saveThemeMode(mode: String)` method

**Files Modified:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/kiranawala/data/local/preferences/PreferencesManager.kt`

**Supported Modes:**
- `"light"` - Force light theme
- `"dark"` - Force dark theme
- `"system"` - Follow system theme (default)

**Next Step:** Add UI selector in Settings screen (ProfileScreen already has hook)

   - Can be enhanced with Google Maps location picker
   - Geocoding can be added for reverse lookup

2. **Theme UI:** Theme preference storage is ready but UI selector not yet added
   - Can be added to ProfileScreen settings section

3. **Address Validation:** No address format validation
   - Can add regex patterns for PIN codes, etc.

## 📝 Developer Notes

### How Login Persistence Works
```kotlin
// SplashScreen checks session on launch
val userId = sessionManager.getCurrentUserId()

// SessionManager reads from Supabase auth + local preferences
// If valid session exists, user is logged in
// If not, user goes to login screen
```

### How Address Management Works
```kotlin
// AddressViewModel manages state
viewModel.addAddress(...) → Repository → Supabase

// Flow-based updates
addressRepository.getUserAddresses(userId)
    .collect { addresses ->
        // UI updates automatically
    }
```

### How Theme Toggle Will Work
```kotlin
// PreferencesManager already has theme storage
preferencesManager.saveThemeMode("dark")
val theme = preferencesManager.themeMode.collectAsState()

// Just need UI to trigger saveThemeMode()
```

---
