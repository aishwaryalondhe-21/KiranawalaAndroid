## Architecture Highlights

### Clean Architecture Pattern
```
UI Components (React)
    ↓
Custom Hooks (React Query + Zustand)
    ↓
Service Layer (Business Logic)
    ↓
Supabase Client (API Integration)
    ↓
Supabase Backend (Database)
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Separate Admin Authentication**
   - New `store_admins` table for admin users
   - Email/password authentication (separate from customer phone auth)
   - Role-based access control (OWNER, MANAGER, STAFF)

2. **Real-Time Updates**
   - Supabase Realtime subscriptions for live order notifications
   - Automatic UI updates when orders change
   - Optimistic UI for better UX

3. **Security**
   - Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data isolation
   - Each admin can only access their store's data
   - Audit logging for compliance
   - HTTPS, CSRF protection, input validation

4. **Performance**
   - Server-side rendering for fast initial load
   - Aggressive caching with React Query
   - Code splitting and lazy loading
   - Image optimization
