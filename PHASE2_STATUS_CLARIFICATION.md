# Phase 2 - Current Status & Clarification

## ✅ What's Actually Working (Built & Tested)

### 1. **Order Success Screen** ✅
**Status:** Fully implemented and integrated

**Navigation Flow:**
```
CheckoutScreen → Place Order → Order Success Screen (with orderId)
```

**How It Works:**
1. When order is placed, `CheckoutViewModel` returns `CheckoutState.Success(orderId)`
2. `CheckoutScreen` detects success and calls `onOrderPlaced(orderId)`
3. NavigationGraph redirects to: `order/success/{orderId}`
4. OrderSuccessScreen loads order details and shows animated success

**If Not Showing:**
- Check logcat for navigation errors
- Verify order is actually being placed successfully
- Check if CheckoutState reaches Success state

**What You Get:**
```
Order Details Screen:
├── Order Header (ID, Date, Status)

## 🔧 Debugging Steps

### If Order Success Doesn't Show

**Check NavigationGraph.kt:**
```kotlin
// Line 164-166 should have:
onOrderPlaced = { orderId ->
    // Navigate to Order Success Screen
    navController.navigate("order/success/$orderId") {
        popUpTo(Routes.HomeScreen.route) { inclusive = false }
    }
}
```

**Check Routes.kt:**
```kotlin
// Should have:
object OrderSuccessScreen : Routes("order/success/{orderId}")
```

**Check OrderSuccessScreen composable:**
```kotlin
// Lines 312-365 in NavigationGraph should have the composable
```

**Logcat Commands:**
```bash
# Filter for navigation
adb logcat | Select-String "Navigation|OrderSuccess"

# Filter for checkout
adb logcat | Select-String "CheckoutViewModel|OrderDetailsViewModel"
```

---

### If Items Not Visible in Order Details

**Check Scroll Position:**
- The items are below the "Items Ordered (N)" header
- Scroll down to see individual item cards
- Each item is in a separate card

**Check Order Object:**
```kotlin
// Verify order.items list is populated
// Check logs: filter by "OrderDetailsViewModel"
```

**Visual Indicators:**
- "Items Ordered (2)" = Header
- Below it: Card 1, Card 2, Card 3... (individual items)
- Each card shows: Name, Price, Qty, Total
