# Google Places Autocomplete Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented Google Places Autocomplete in the Kiranawala Android app for the Manage Addresses feature. Users can now search and select addresses from Google's autocomplete suggestions instead of typing manually.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Dependencies Added
**File**: `app/build.gradle.kts`
```kotlin
implementation("com.google.android.libraries.places:places:3.5.0")
```

### 2. Places SDK Initialization
**File**: `MainActivity.kt`
- Initialized Places SDK in `onCreate()` with API key: `AIzaSyAU8kwc-Ih9VEOJB3QnEll1YC-I97W3yQw`
- Added safety check with `Places.isInitialized()` to prevent duplicate initialization

```kotlin
if (!Places.isInitialized()) {
    Places.initialize(applicationContext, "AIzaSyAU8kwc-Ih9VEOJB3QnEll1YC-I97W3yQw")
}
```

### 3. PlacesAutocompleteField Component
**File**: `app/src/main/java/com/kiranawala/presentation/components/PlacesAutocompleteField.kt`

**Features**:
- ✅ Fullscreen autocomplete mode
- ✅ Non-editable, click-only TextField
- ✅ Captures: ID, NAME, ADDRESS, LAT_LNG
- ✅ Professional UI with location icon
- ✅ Error handling for API failures and user cancellation
- ✅ Custom supporting text and error messages
- ✅ Uses `rememberLauncherForActivityResult` for modern Activity Result API

**PlaceDetails Data Class**:
```kotlin
data class PlaceDetails(
    val id: String,
    val name: String,
    val address: String,
    val latitude: Double,
    val longitude: Double
)
```

### 4. Integration in AddressFormScreen
**File**: `app/src/main/java/com/kiranawala/presentation/screens/address/AddressFormScreen.kt`

**Changes**:
- Replaced manual `OutlinedTextField` with `PlacesAutocompleteField`
- Made latitude/longitude mutable to store selected coordinates
- Automatically populates address and coordinates when user selects from Places API
- Maintains existing functionality for building name, flat number, labels, and default address settings

**Usage Example**:
```kotlin
PlacesAutocompleteField(
    value = addressLine,
    onPlaceSelected = { placeDetails ->
        addressLine = placeDetails.address
        latitude = placeDetails.latitude
        longitude = placeDetails.longitude
    },
    label = "Address Line *",
    placeholder = "Click to search address",
    supportingText = "Search and select your complete address",
    modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth()
)
```

## User Experience

### How It Works:
1. User navigates to Add/Edit Address screen
2. Clicks on the "Address Line" field (with location icon)
3. Fullscreen Google Places Autocomplete opens
4. User types to search for their address
5. User selects from suggestions
6. Address, latitude, and longitude are automatically filled
7. User can add optional building name, flat number
8. User selects address label (Home/Work/Other)
9. User can set as default address
10. Saves complete address with geocoordinates

### Error Handling:
- ✅ API errors display in the TextField's supporting text
- ✅ User cancellation is handled gracefully (no action)
- ✅ Invalid selections are caught and reported
- ✅ Visual error state with red outline when errors occur

## Permissions
The app already has necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:
- `INTERNET` - Required for Places API calls
- `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` - Check network connectivity
- `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` & `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` - For location-based features

## Testing Steps

### To Test the Implementation:
1. **Sync Gradle**: 
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

2. **Run the app** on emulator/device

3. **Navigate** to Profile → Manage Addresses → Add New Address

4. **Click** on the "Address Line" field (it should be non-editable)

5. **Autocomplete screen** should open in fullscreen mode

6. **Type** an address (e.g., "Mumbai Central")

7. **Select** from suggestions

8. **Verify** the address is populated in the field

9. **Fill** remaining fields (building, flat, label)

10. **Save** the address

### Expected Result:
- Address field shows selected address
- Coordinates are captured (can verify in database)
- User can complete form and save
- Address appears in address list

## API Key Security Note

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: The API key is currently hardcoded in the app. For production:

1. **Restrict the API key** in Google Cloud Console:
   - Set application restrictions (Android apps)
   - Add package name: `com.kiranawalaandroid`
   - Add SHA-1 certificate fingerprints
   - Enable only Places API

2. **Consider moving to BuildConfig**:
   ```kotlin
   // In build.gradle.kts
   buildConfigField("String", "PLACES_API_KEY", "\"YOUR_API_KEY\"")
   
   // In code
   Places.initialize(applicationContext, BuildConfig.PLACES_API_KEY)
   ```

3. **Monitor usage** in Google Cloud Console to avoid unexpected charges

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified:
1. `app/build.gradle.kts` - Added Places SDK dependency
2. `app/src/main/java/com/kiranawala/MainActivity.kt` - Initialized Places SDK
3. `app/src/main/java/com/kiranawala/presentation/screens/address/AddressFormScreen.kt` - Integrated autocomplete field

### Created:
1. `app/src/main/java/com/kiranawala/presentation/components/PlacesAutocompleteField.kt` - Reusable autocomplete component

## Benefits

✅ **Better UX**: Users don't need to type full addresses manually
✅ **Accurate Data**: Google-verified addresses with correct coordinates
✅ **Reduced Errors**: Less typos and incorrect addresses
✅ **Professional**: Modern, polished user experience
✅ **Reusable**: `PlacesAutocompleteField` can be used anywhere in the app
✅ **Geocoding**: Automatic latitude/longitude capture for delivery optimization

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. Add country/region bias to show local results first
2. Restrict to specific place types (addresses only, no businesses)
3. Add recent searches/favorites
4. Implement manual address entry fallback option
5. Add address validation after selection
6. Show map preview of selected location

## Support

For issues or questions:
- Check Google Places SDK documentation
- Verify API key is active and has quota
- Ensure device/emulator has internet connection
- Check Logcat for detailed error messages
