# ✅ Phone OTP Authentication - READY!

## What's Done:
1. ✅ Database updated (phone-only, no email)
2. ✅ CustomerEntity updated
3. ✅ AuthRepository updated for OTP
4. ✅ New use cases: SendOTPUseCase, VerifyOTPUseCase
5. ✅ AuthViewModel updated for OTP flow

## Next: Update UI Screens

The LoginScreen and SignUpScreen need to be updated for phone + OTP.

### New Flow:
1. **Login/Signup Screen** - Enter phone number → Send OTP
2. **OTP Screen** - Enter 6-digit OTP → Verify
3. **If new user** - Also enter name during signup

## To Complete:
Run: `.\build-with-jdk17.bat`

The backend is ready. UI screens need updating to:
- Replace email/password fields with phone number field
- Add OTP input screen
- Handle OTP flow (send → verify)

Should I create the new phone OTP UI screens now?
