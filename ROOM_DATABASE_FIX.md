# Room Database Crash Fix - RESOLVED ✅

## Problem
App crashed on launch with error:
```
java.lang.IllegalStateException: Room cannot verify the data integrity. 
Looks like you've changed schema but forgot to update the version number.
Expected identity hash: b8171c188997e71d0e882ae95ef8942b
Found: dca95f7c11bbda92c102d65c480413a4
```

## Root Cause
Room database schema was modified but the version number remained at 2. Room detected schema hash mismatch and crashed.

## Solution Applied
**Incremented database version from 2 to 3** in `AppDatabase.kt`

```kotlin
@Database(
    entities = [...],
    version = 3,  // ← Changed from 2 to 3
    exportSchema = true
)
```

Since `fallbackToDestructiveMigration()` is already configured in `DatabaseModule.kt`, the database will be recreated automatically on first launch after update.

## Important Notes

### User Impact
⚠️ **Users will lose local data** (cart, cached stores) when they update to this version because the database will be recreated.

This is acceptable for development but for production you should:
1. Add proper migrations
2. Or sync data with backend before migration
3. Or notify users about data reset

### Development Workflow
When you change Room entities in future:
1. **Always increment the version number** in `AppDatabase.kt`
2. Test on a clean install or uninstall/reinstall the app
3. Add migrations for production builds

### Testing
To test the fix:
1. **Uninstall the app** from device (to clear old database)
2. Install new APK
3. App should launch successfully

OR just install new APK directly - `fallbackToDestructiveMigration()` will handle it.

## Build Commands
```bash
# Set JDK
set JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17.0.1

# Build
gradlew.bat assembleDebug

# Or use existing script
build-with-jdk17.bat
```
