## üîç Verification Queries

Run these in Supabase SQL Editor to verify data:

```sql
-- Check stores
SELECT id, name, address, minimum_order_value, is_open 
FROM stores;

-- Check products
SELECT p.name, p.price, p.category, s.name as store_name 
FROM products p 
JOIN stores s ON p.store_id = s.id;

-- Check RLS policies
SELECT tablename, policyname, cmd 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename IN ('stores', 'products');
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: No stores showing
**Solution:**
- Check internet connection
- Verify Supabase URL is correct in `build.gradle.kts`
- Check Logcat for errors
- Verify RLS policies allow public read access

### Issue: Products not loading
**Solution:**
- Verify products table has data
- Check store_id foreign keys are correct
- Ensure `is_available = true` in products table

### Issue: Search not working
**Solution:**
- Check Logcat for errors
- Verify Postgrest is installed in Supabase
- Test search queries directly in Supabase SQL Editor

### Issue: Build errors
**Solution:**
```bash
.\gradlew.bat clean
.\gradlew.bat assembleDebug
```
